## Introduction 🌍
The project aims to develop a sustainable energy solution for a lunar outpost using a Nuclear Fission-based Surface Power System (FSPS). The proposed model incorporates embedded flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and demand uncertainties, minimizing the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE).

        python src/utils/models/costModel.py
        ```
    - For capacity modeling:
        ```bash
        python src/utils/models/capacityModel.py
        ```
    - For demand modeling:
        ```bash
        python src/utils/models/demandModel.py
        ```

## Methodology 📈
The methodology follows a structured, four-phase framework to design a flexible lunar energy system under demand uncertainty:

1. **Baseline Design Concept and Uncertainty Recognition**
2. **Embedded Flexibility**
3. **Optimization Function**
4. **Analysis and Testing**

## Case Application 🛰️
The case application integrates power system sizing, cost modeling, and energy demand requirements to evaluate different strategies. The scenarios analyzed include both flexible and inflexible deployment strategies.

## Results and Discussion 📊
The results show that embedding flexibility in the FSPS design can reduce the LCOE by approximately 5.49% and significantly decrease the variance in LCOE compared to inflexible strategies. Detailed results and sensitivity analyses are provided in the `Results and Discussion` section of the thesis.

## Conclusion 🏁
The research demonstrates that incorporating flexibility into the design of FSPS can offer significant financial and operational benefits, making it a viable solution for managing the uncertainties of lunar energy demands.

## Future Work 🔭
Future research can explore integrating potential revenue streams, refining penalty cost models, and enhancing the complexity of uncertainty modeling. Empirical testing and validation in simulated lunar environments can further validate the model's applicability.
